Description: A (not yet exhaustive) collection of common models of risk
    processes in actuarial science, represented as formal S4 classes. Each class
    (risk model) has a simulator of its path, and a plotting function. Further, 
    a Monte-Carlo estimator of a ruin probability for a finite time is
    implemented, using a parallel computation. The package extends two classical
    risk models Cramer-Lundberg and Sparre Andersen models by including capital
    injections (positive jumps). The intent of the package is to provide a
    user-friendly interface for ruin processes' simulators, as well as a solid 
    extenssible structure for future extenssions.
